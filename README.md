#PRODIGY_CY_Task-02
Image Encryption and Decryption using Pixel Manipulation
This repository contains a Python program that performs encryption and decryption on images by manipulating pixel color channels. The technique used involves swapping the red and blue color channels of each pixel.

##How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   git clone https://github.com/KKGOKUL/PRODIGY_CY_TASK-01.git

2. Download ZIP File: Download the ZIP file from this repository and extract it to your desired location.

# Run the Program: Navigate to the directory containing the program and execute it using Python. You can run the script as follows:

python image_encryption.py

**Encryption Example**

Do you want to (e)ncrypt or (d)ecrypt the image? e
Enter the path to the input image: C:\path\to\input.jpg
Enter the path to save the encrypted image: C:\path\to\encrypted_img.jpg
Image encrypted successfully!

**Decryption Example**

Do you want to (e)ncrypt or (d)ecrypt the image? d
Enter the path to the encrypted image: C:\path\to\encrypted_img.jpg
Enter the path to save the decrypted image: C:\path\to\decrypted_img.jpg
Image decrypted successfully!

**Note: Set the path image from your computer in the program before run .**
